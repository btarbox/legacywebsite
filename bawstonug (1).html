          We are a Wicked Cool User Group</h1>
Meet others interested in all aspects of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Gather to discuss Development, Standards, Networks, Marketing, Promotion and Business opportunities using AWS. Our group is more technical, so we look for relevant topic matter, and stay away from sales presentations. This Meetup is open to anyone interested in learning more about Amazon Web Services!<br>
And now for some details...<br>
Since the lockdown ...<br><br>
We've switched to zoom based meeting like everyone else.  We've been meeting alternate Thursdays since March 2020, with meetings starting at 5:30.  Our Twitter handle is Awsugboston.
<br><br>
Upcoming Scheduled Meetups: <br><br>In general, we meet alternate Thursdays, from 5:30-7pm, with 5:30-5:50pm for socializing, and 6-7pm for presentations. Sometimes we do a single long presentation, other times we have several shorter (30-40 minute) presentations. <br>
Attendance: We usually have an attendance of approx. 30-60+ depending on location and topic - and we normally hold these Meetups in the Boston area - however, we are branching out to other areas/facilities. Our attendees are generally in the middle ground between novice and expert, with many in the dev/ops space. If an RSVP list is desired, this can be provided to the host sponsor, however, it ONLY includes the member's Meetup profile name (may not be their real name) and profile link - it does Not contain direct email contact info.<br><br><br>
Presentations: If you wish to present, contact the Organizer (see below). Suggest a topic and an upcoming meeting(s) that you would be available to present. Then we will need an abstract of the presentation (title and descriptive info) and a bit about the presenter (brief bio, just a few words). We generally have 2-3 presentations/presenters per Meetup without repetition from recent past meetups. If 2 presentations, then these are usually 40min with Q&A. Usually the main sponsor is provided the choice of topic and presentation slot. Our attendees are looking for technical depth and NOT a sales pitch - so please keep this in mind when proposing and creating your presentation. Sometimes it is what you don't say that is important - for example, if you wanted to expose the need for your solution, you can point out all the Amazon-native methods of solving a problem, and in the presentation it becomes clear that an additional solution is needed. Again, we stay away from sales presentations.
Itâ€™s important that speakers speak loud and clear, in the event a PA system is not available. Also, when questions are asked, the presenter should repeat the question so that all can hear and understand the context of the answer.<br>
Presentation - Slides: Usually there are requests for slides after a presentation. We request that presenters post a link to the slides used, as a comment in the applicable Meetup event page. Any comments go to the entire group of subscribers (who have notifications enabled).
Sponsorship: Sponsors have first dibs on presentations (which need to be AWS-centric and Not a product demo). Sponsors are provided time during the Meetup to address attendees. In general the sponsors arrange food/drink AND location - and this can be split up (co-sponsorship). The moderators of this Meetup group do not arrange or supply the meeting space.  We can always add an event to the calendar, so if you are interested in sponsorship, please reach out to the Organizer (see below). Special events are welcome.
